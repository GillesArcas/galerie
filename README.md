# journal
An utility to format a basic markdown diary into various html forms. The markdown is basic enough to be edited on a smartphone when travelling (see example in example directory). 

The html pages generated are:

* A page with the same information as in the markdown reference,
* an extended page including all photos from a DCIM directory,
* a page ready to export to Blogger.
