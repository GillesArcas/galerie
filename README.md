Make html galleries from media directories. Organize by dates, by subdirs or by
the content of a diary file. The diary file is a markdown file organized by
dates, each day described by a text and some medias (photos and movies).

The diary file can be exported to:

* an html file with the text and subset of medias associated with each day,
* the previous html file extended with all medias in the media directory,
* an html file ready to import into Blogger.
